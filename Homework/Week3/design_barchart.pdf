The margin is determined to fit y-axis values of for the points and the label "Points" and x-axis names of the countries. 

The y-axis values are chosen with intervals of 10 because the bars are of such heights that in this way their values can easily be estimated. This axis does have a label so it is more clearly what these values represent.

The x-axis values are the names of the countries. This axis does not have a label because it is needless to say what is represented. The values are rotated 45 degrees so that it is easier to read them without tilting your head too much. 

The bars are filled with the midnightblue color for it is easy on the eyes and clearly visible and the bars do not contain a value judgment so this doesn't need to be visualized. The bar hover color is crimson red, this gives a clear contrast with the midnightblue so it is obvious your mouse is over that bar, and also the tooltip has the same color, with clearly readable white text inside it.
